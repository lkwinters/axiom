A rookie grant from JCPenny has provided us the opportunity to go forth with competing in FRC. Our two FTC teams, the Solinoids and the AdaGraces, will join forces to compete as one 16 person team. As a rookie team, we plan on going into this competition season focusing on one challenge aspect in order to restrain ourselves from getting in over our heads. The 6 week time restraint is something we have never faced and in order to finish in time we must remember to have good time management and to stay organized. Throughout this competition we will be receiving aid from professional engineers to guide us through our work.
